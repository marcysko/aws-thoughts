# aws-thoughts

## Description

Refactored the existing MERN application Deep Thoughts https://github.com/marcysko/deep-thoughts, which allows users to sign up and create an account, post their thoughts, and share their thoughts and images with other users. Deployed this app to the cloud using AWS and replaced the back-end API to use cloud resources for storage, database, and computing. Configured a database service with DynamoDB, stored and retrieved static assets using S3, and deployed the app on an Ubuntu server to an EC2 instance.
